# Orange County WordCamp 2018 - "Off-Grid Plugins" Presentation

This is a collection of the slideshow and resources referenced and provided during the "Off-Grid Plugins: Updates Outside of WordPress.org" presentation by [Mike Karikas](https://github.com/karikas).  Quick reference to the final plugin server can be found at [github.com/karikas/wordpress-remote-plugin-updates](https://github.com/karikas/wordpress-remote-plugin-updates).

_An off-grid plugin is a plugin not stored on WordPress.org, but still has all the neat features of one (updates, robust information, pictures, etc)_

Chances are pretty good that the remote server URLs will be offline within a week of this presentation.
